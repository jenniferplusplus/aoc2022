# Summary

Well, ok. That was a pain. Not building the filesystem tree. That was actually fine. (Although I still don't love that I have to be aware of pointers. I'm not convinced that's actually good or even necessary for golang.) But recursive functions of unknown size seemed like a good time for me to break out the much vaunted golang ✨concurrency model✨

To sum it up, I have not figured out a good way to organize that yet.
