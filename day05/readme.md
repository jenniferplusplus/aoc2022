# Summary

I'm not sure what to say, exactly? This challenge is about juggling stacks around, so obviously it's a bunch of stacks. It's inconvenient that indexing a string gives runes instead of single character strings. Um, I wish golang had basic convenience functions like map, filter, reduce? It's extremely weird that a programming language wouldn't have those things in 2022.

Oh, I guess I can say something about the input? I get that the input being a giant pain to work with is part of the challenge. But, like, come on.
