# Summary

The basic challenge here is to build a scoring app for rock-paper-scissors. Rock-paper-scissors seems like a problem that demands a state machine, so that's what I did.

Lessons learned: It's on purpose that it's hard to get side effects out of a state machine. That stuff should happen external to the state machine.
